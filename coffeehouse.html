                    <p>Coffee House is an international coffee shop app for daily coffee takers. For this project, we decided to use a goal-directed design method which revolves around focusing on our persona creation and goals. The MVP for this product was developed as a mobile based application rather than being web-based to showcase our mobile design skillset.​</p>

                <h3>Kick Off</h3>
                <p>In this project, I took a goal-directed design approach that proved to be quite effective in my design efforts. I found qualitative research methods to be the most useful, consisting of a  literature review, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews, and most important our persona hypothesis construction. I started out by asking myself some initial key questions.​</p>

                <p>"What is the product and who is it for?"​</p>
                <p>"What do our primary users need most?"​</p>
                <p>"Which users are the most important to the business?"​</p>
                <p>"What challenges could we face moving forward?"​</p>
                <p>"What literature should we review to familiarize ourselves?"​</p>

        <!-- Affinity -->

        <div class="affinity">
            <p>I found data from our Usability Study to be the most effective understandings I garnered. I then used an affinity diagram to separate the data into groups of tasks which were further categorized by high level goals for improvement in efficiency, process, depth, and familiarity. ﻿Recognizing the conflicts of interest from each audience allowed us to focus on shaping user goals and how those goals would in-turn also affect the business' goals.​</p>
