          In this project, I took a goal-directed design approach that proved to
          be quite effective in my design efforts. I found qualitative research
          methods to be the most useful, consisting of a literature review,
          competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews, and most important our
          persona hypothesis construction. I started out by asking myself some
          initial key questions. ​
