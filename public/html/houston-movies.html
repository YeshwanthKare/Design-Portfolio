                            Houston Movies is an international 
                            Movie Review app for all types of audience. 
			                For this project, we decided 
                            to use a goal-directed design method 
                            which revolves around focusing on 
                            our persona creation and goals. 
                            The MVP for this product was 
                            developed as a mobile based 
                            application as well as web-based 
			                to showcase our mobile and Web design skillset.​

                <h3>Kick Off</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I took a goal-directed design 
                    approach that proved to be quite effective 
                    in my design efforts. I found qualitative 
                    research methods to be the most useful, 
                    consisting of a  literature review, 
                    competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews, 
                    and most important our persona hypothesis 
                    construction. I started out by asking myself 
                    some initial key questions.

                    <h3>Research & Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted user research and received 
                        feedback from users that we incorporated 
                        into user personas. For example, our user 
                        persona, Matt, is a 19-year old college 
                        student and full-time employee who loves 
                        action movies with science fiction. 
                        The research revealed that Matt was 
                        frustrated by the navigation to the 
                        tickets booking section that made ticket 
                        booking so confusing. We also learned 
                        that Matt is often not happy with the 
                        navigation bar. Matt would like to see 
                        improvements to the app, like bigger 
                        buttons, simple icons, and minimal design. 
                        Since Matt browses for pleasure, he would 
                        also like to see more options that allow 
                        him to navigate to his favorite movies and 
                        allow them to browse by genres.

                    I constructed a user flow of what a basic 
                    start to finish journey looks like 
                    while booking tickets. This helps us 
                    in understanding ways users can interact 
                    with the product, as well as gives me an understanding
                    to see navigation through user goals.

                After sketching out some paper wireframes and

                reviewed what was necessary, unnecessary , 
                and what areas needed improvement. I poured a 
                lot of our time into this step to make sure I 
                had the finishing touches on the underlying UX 
                before moving onto the visuals for both the mobile 
                and the web apps.

                        After creating our prototype from low 
                        fidelity wireframes, I conducted a peer 
                        to peer review  to fill out before I began 
                        to conducting a usability test. I asked 2 
                        different participants to run through 
                        different scenarios in my prototype in 
                        hopes of garnering enough feedback to use 
                        for my next set of design iterations.​

                            because the user was not able to navigate to the

                            as user did not witness any of the nav options in the navbar

                            makes user difficult to search the movies in the WatchList

                            the summary setup to be have an other page to be allocated
                            such that the user felt that it could be easy for users to
                            differentiate the arrangement with in the app.
