                        the better user experience, This website 
                        also provides the users of all kinds to 
                        watch the movie trailer and to review the 
                        movie with in our website, Houston movies 
                        allow audience to book the movie tickets 
                        in theaters which were in Houston, This

                        <p>
                            Houston Movies is an international 
                            Movie Review app for all types of audience. 
			                For this project, we decided 
                            to use a goal-directed design method 
                            which revolves around focusing on 
                            our persona creation and goals. 
                            The MVP for this product was 
                            developed as a mobile based 
                            application as well as web-based 
			                to showcase our mobile and Web design skillset.​

                <h3>Kick Off</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I took a goal-directed design 
                    approach that proved to be quite effective 
                    in my design efforts. I found qualitative 
                    research methods to be the most useful, 
                    consisting of a  literature review, 
                    competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews, 
                    and most important our persona hypothesis 
                    construction. I started out by asking myself 
                    some initial key questions.

                    <h3>Research & Problems</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted user research and received 
                        feedback from users that we incorporated 
                        into user personas. For example, our user 
                        persona, Matt, is a 19-year old college 
                        student and full-time employee who loves 
                        action movies with science fiction. 
                        The research revealed that Matt was 
                        frustrated by the navigation to the 
                        tickets booking section that made ticket 
                        booking so confusing. We also learned 
                        that Matt is often not happy with the 
                        navigation bar. Matt would like to see 
                        improvements to the app, like bigger 
                        buttons, simple icons, and minimal design. 
                        Since Matt browses for pleasure, he would 
                        also like to see more options that allow 
                        him to navigate to his favorite movies and 
                        allow them to browse by genres.
